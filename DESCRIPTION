Description: This package provides easy tools for outlier robust inference.
    The user specifies a reference distribution against which observations are
    judged to determine whether they are outliers or not. After removing the
    outliers, adjusted standard errors are automatically provided. Furthermore,
    several staistical tests for the false positive rate can be calculated. The
    outlier removing algorithm can be iterated a fixed number of times or until
    the procedure converges.
